# Third Screen

Second screen is when you're on your phone while Netflix plays in the background—the TV becomes secondary. **Third Screen** is the opposite: one glance gives you everything you don't stare at constantly.

A macOS dashboard that surfaces all your ambient info in one place: time, schedule, todos, media, batteries, shortcuts. No digging through apps.
